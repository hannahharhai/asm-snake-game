# Snake Game

A simple game where you play as a snake and try to collect apples. The more apples you eat the bigger your snake will become, but be careful because running into yourself or out the bounds of the frame will cause "GAME OVER"!

This project was built in MIPS assembly language and is meant to be run on MARS Assembler.
